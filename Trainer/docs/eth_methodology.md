# ETHEREUM Classification Methodology


## Goals (Un filtered)

* Adding features based on graph theory and network Analysis
* Distinguishing between bots from humans
* Smart Contract Analysis
* Repeating Analysis for ERC-20 token transaction activity

* Todays trade volume to average monthly volume
* Highest Volume time range throughout the day and month
* current amount of crypto in exchange wallet
* Fluctuation range prediction of certain Time
* News Correlation
* Unusual Big Transactions classification

* Average buy/sell price against transactions

* Github Activity of Crypto/Token against transaction activity

* Portfolio Analysis based on wallet holdings

# Meta Metrics (Deep Info)

 - Times sent to a particular tag address
 - Times received from a particular tag address
 - Price to Transaction
 - Twitter Mentions
 - Transaction History to Price Chart
 - Github activity of Project to specific Token Address Correlation
 - Social Mentions to Transaction Volume Correlation
 - Smart Contract de-compile & Bug report

# Tag Designations

 ## Summary

 The first 3 tags are generated by information directly acquired from the
 internet from 'trusted' sources

 The next 5 tags are committed tags that can change but require human
 intervention to do so

 The final 2 tag slots are for pre-committed tags

### Static tags
 tag_1 : general information (scraped)
 tag_2 : meta information (scraped)
 tag_3 : smart_contract || external address (api_generated)

### Trained Tags
 tag_4 : trained & generated tag
 tag_5 : trained & generated tag
 tag_6 : 90% sure generated tag
 tag_7 : 45% sure generated tag
 tag_8 : 20 % sure generated tag

### Speculative tags from training
 tag_9 : speculative tag
 tag_10 : speculative tag

 (*Further Tagging may occur as the data combinatorics expands*)
